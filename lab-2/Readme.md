# The Game
In Set, you will have a board of 12 cards by default. If there are no sets in the 12 card board, 3 cards will be added until there is a set on the board. The first player to find a set will say "Set!" and click their player name button. They will then click on the cards that make up the set that they found. If they found a valid set, they will earn a point and 3 new cards will be dealt if there were 12 cards on the board. The game ends when the deck is empty and there is no longer any sets possible in the current hand.
